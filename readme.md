# Simple XML-RPC example in Java 

This is a simple example showing how to implement a client and a server using XML-RPC.

To execute this example you should run Server.java and Client.java separately.

The server will start listening in port 8080 and the cliente will connect to the server and it will excute a couple of remote methods.
